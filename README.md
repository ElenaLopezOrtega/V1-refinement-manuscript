Image and data analysis code from manuscript "Stimulus-dependent synaptic plasticity underlies neuronal circuitry refinement in the mouse primary visual cortex".

Calcium imaging analysis:
2P images were analyzed with "GenerateAllFigurePanels_ScanImageWorkflow_Paninski4_SRP6ori". 
Generated datas sets were analyzed with "SRP_GCaMP6_analysis_ROIs" (Figures 1 and 2) and "ROIs_longitudinal analysis" (Figure 3).

Spine dynamics and AMPAR analysis:
2P images were analyzed with MapManager (mapmanager.net).
Generated data sets were analyzed with getmyMapListValuesCond (AMPAR, Figures 5 - 7) and getmyMapListValuesCondDyn_v2 (spine dynamics, Figure 4).
